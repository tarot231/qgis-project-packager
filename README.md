# Project Packager

This QGIS plugin exports a portable project by copying data scattered on storage into a specified folder. When exporting, you can choose to copy the original files or store the data in a single GeoPackage. Note that if there is data that cannot be stored in GeoPackage, storage in GeoPackage will be disabled.

## TODO

- Draw the icon and replace it, with respect :sos:
