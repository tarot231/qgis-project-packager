# Project Packager

This QGIS plugin exports a portable project by copying the data scattered on the disk into a specified directory. On output, the directory structure below the project home is copied, but unnecessary files are not copied. The supported data are those loaded by GDAL/OGR.

## TODO

- Draw the icon and replace it, with respect :sos:
